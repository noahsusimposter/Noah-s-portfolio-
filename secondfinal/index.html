    <h1>Welcome to my School Project Website</h1>
    <p>This website is all about my learning experience in programming. Here, you'll find information about different programming languages and my personal reflections.</p>
    <p>In the 'Programming Languages' section, you'll find a table showcasing four programming languages that I have learned about. On the 'Reflection' page, I share my thoughts and experiences throughout the course.</p>
