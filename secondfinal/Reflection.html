    <p>The cours was a great learning experience for me. I learned a lot about programing and enjoyed it greatly.</p>
    <p>JavaScript was one of the topics I really enjoyed. It's a versitile language widely used in web developement and I found it interesting to learn.</p>
    <p>Creating virtual machines with VirtualBox was another aspect I found intriguing. It was fascinating to learn how to create and manage virtual environments.</p>
    <p>I also learned about HTML. It's the foundational language of the web, and understanding it has given me a better grasp of how websites are built.</p>
